## Overview

This is meant to apply an opinionated set of treatments to a Java-based project using Gradle.

So far this means:

1. Versioning
2. Testing library dependency (JUnit 5)
3. Separating test categories into distinct source sets (test=unit, integrationTest=you guessed it)
4. JVM compatibility
5. Formatting and linting

I  have no idea if this works yet.
